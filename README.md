# ML-Linear-Regression

- Statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

2 Factors to examine:

1. Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variables?
2. How significant is the Regression line to make predictions with highest possible accuracy.

The simplest form of a single linear regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is represented by:

The blue points represent the actual Y values and the brown points represents the predicted Y values. The distance between the actual and the predicted values are known as Residuals or Errors. The best fit line should have the least sum of squares of these errors also known as e square.

Minimizing the Distance: There are a lot of ways to minimize the distance between the line and the data points like Sum of Squared Errors, Sum of Absolute Errors, Root Mean Square error etc.
